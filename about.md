We are a family business based in the beautiful Fraser Valley of British Columbia. Our Western Red Cedar comes from sustainably managed forests in British Columbia . We are immensely proud to say we have mill direct, local source, for our cedar products. Our business model is simple, "High Quality, Fair Prices". We value all feedback to ensure our standards can meet and exceed your expectations. We truly listen to what you need for your space. Whether cutting edge interior design or warm and cozy; create a lovely atmosphere with our cedar products.  With our personalized stamp process "your name" goes on the underside of each piece, to give that special thought to pass along from generation to generation. So many stories are told from seeing the beautiful wear marks on an old wooden table or bench. Let us start your story today.
